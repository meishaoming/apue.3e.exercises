> 4.8 When running the program in Figure 4.16, we check the available disk space with the df(1) command. Why didnâ€™t we use the du(1) command?


```
     The du utility displays the file system block usage for each file argument and for each directory in the
     file hierarchy rooted in each directory argument.  If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy
     rooted in the current directory is displayed.
```

```
     The df utility displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified filesystem or on the
     filesystem of which file is a part.  Values are displayed in 512-byte per block counts.  If neither a file
     or a filesystem operand is specified, statistics for all mounted filesystems are displayed (subject to the
     -t option below).
```
